# Conductance Based Stabilized Supralinear Network

Model and test, plot functions are all in Jupyter notebooks.
* default_model.ipynb: The most initial model as well as the parameters. Some settings can be changed after a full discussion.
* acceleration_model.ipynb:Models that can use the acceleration method. which gives functions for the two base tasks. In fact, for any task, the model can be used without any special tuning. Note: Network.store() and Network.restore() cannot be used!

Run the following line in terminal to install requirements:
 `pip install -r requirements.txt`

We recommend that each person can create their own Notebook when using it, due to the different tasks we try to solve. However, after a thorough discussion, we need to make changes to the default model and the acceleration model, then these updates need to be noticed and pulled in time!
